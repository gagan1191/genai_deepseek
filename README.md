# DeepSeek-R1 Local Testing with Agno

This repository demonstrates how to test the `deepseek-r1` model locally using the Agno framework and access it through an agent. In this example, we use the `Ollama` model for interaction.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Agno package
- Ollama installed and running (or substitute your own model if needed)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   
   Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed. You can install the required Python packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip install agno ollama
   ```

2. **Code Overview**:

   The following code snippet demonstrates how to configure and use the agent:

   ```python
   from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
   from agno.models.ollama import Ollama
   from typing import List

   # Initialize the agent with the deepseek-r1 model from Ollama
   agent = Agent(
       model=Ollama(id="deepseek-r1"),
       markdown=True
   )

   # Uncomment the line below to use a custom DeepSeek model if preferred
   # agent = Agent(model=DeepSeek(), markdown=True)

   # Request a response from the agent
   agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")
   ```

   In this code:

   - We import the necessary classes from `agno` and `ollama`.
   - We create an `Agent` instance with the `deepseek-r1` model by specifying its ID.
   - We ask the agent to generate a short horror story using the `print_response` method.

3. **Running the Code**:

   Once the environment is set up, you can run the script to see how the model responds to your query. Simply execute the Python file in your terminal:

   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```

   You should see the agent's response printed in your terminal.

### Notes

- By default, this setup uses the `Ollama` model, which you can replace with any other compatible model.
- If you wish to experiment with a different model or use the original `DeepSeek`, simply comment/uncomment the relevant lines.
